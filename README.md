# NonoGen
Anna-Samsara Daefler (avd2131)

## Lexical Analysis
I developed a scanner that processes NonoGen source code and outputs a list of tokens. My scanner shows state
transitions with finite automata. Lexical errors in the input program are handled by the parser printing a message
and advancing to the next character, such that the user can view and correct all lexical errors in one pass.

### Lexical Grammar
The following list provides a lexical specification of rules in order of priority.

1) ('NEW', r'new')
2) ('SPECIFIER', r'design|random')
3) ('FUNCTION', r'print|play')
4) ('ATTRIBUTE', r'title|hints')
5) ('GRID_SPECIFIER', r'\.|#|\.\n|#\n')
6) ('ARROW', r'->')
7) ('EQUALS', r'=')
8) ('TIMES', r'x')
9) ('IDENTIFIER', r'[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*')
10) ('INTEGER', r'\d+')
11) ('STRING', r'".*"')
12) ('LBRACE', r'{')
13) ('RBRACE', r'}')
14) ('LPAREN', r'(')
15) ('RPAREN', r')')
16) ('WHITESPACE', r'\s+')

## Syntactic Analysis
I implemented a parser that takes the sequence of tokens generated by my scanner and constructs 
a syntax tree that represents the hierarchical syntactic structure of the source code. I used
recursive descent parsing. If there is an error in parsing, my parser will print a message to 
the user with suggestions to fix the syntax error and will move ahead to the next statement
where it will continue parsing. Therefore, other syntax errors in the program can be detected in
one pass.

### Context-Free Grammar
S --> IDENTIFIER I | FUNCTION ( IDENTIFIER )

I --> EQUALS NEW SPECIFIER { N } | ARROW ATTRIBUTE EQUALS A

N --> GRID_SPECIFIER G | INTEGER TIMES INTEGER

G --> GRID_SPECIFIER G | Îµ

A --> STRING | INTEGER

### Code Generation
This stage processes the parsed structure of the program from the syntactic analysis phase and outputs another high level
language (Python code). I developed a pipeline to further execute the generated code to produce the expected output of my
program.

## Executing Compiler
Use the shell script compile.sh to execute the compiler. Please make sure the system has Python3.

```./compile.sh <input_file>```

### Input Programs
Sample input programs can be found under samples/input_programs/ with their corresponding
expected outputs under samples/outputs/. 

* Programs 1,2, and 5 demonstrate valid input programs.
* Program 3 demonstrates a syntactic error. The 'new' keyword is missing.
* Program 4 demonstrates a semantic error. The program tries to set the 'title' attribute for a game that has not been declared.
